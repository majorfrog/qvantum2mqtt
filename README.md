# qvantum2mqtt

Simple python app that communicates with the qvantum api: https://api.qvantum.com/

Publishes the data on the configured mqtt broker.

Makes it possible to monitor all your devices.

Written to work well with home assistant for easy integration. Possible to set settings over MQTT and HA.

# LIMITS

Note! This is a WIP. The API is not yet fully available, so this app cannot be completed.

Hopefully it will be possible to fully integrate later this year.
